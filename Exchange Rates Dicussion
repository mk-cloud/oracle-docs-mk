Detailed Summary:
The team discussed enhancements to the currency exchange rate process, focusing on incorporating the Chilean peso (CLP) and potentially other LATAM currencies (like DOP and Paraguay) into the existing exchange rate update program. The current API supports fetching exchange rates between a source and a destination currency for a specified date range, but only one pair per call. The team proposed modifying the program to loop through a lookup list of required currencies, calling the API for each, and storing the results in the GL rates table without overwriting existing data. The need for flexibility to add more currencies in the future was emphasized. There was also discussion about sharing and reviewing the program details to ensure the changes are feasible and efficient.

Action Items:
1. Update the existing exchange rate program to handle the Chilean peso (CLP) in addition to the Dominican peso (DOP), and ensure it can be extended for other LATAM currencies in the future.
2. Modify the program logic to use a lookup list of destination currencies, looping through each and calling the API with the following parameters: source currency, destination currency, start date, and end date.
3. Ensure the program stores the fetched exchange rates in the GL rates table, taking care not to overwrite existing data.
4. Share the current program details with the team for review and feedback.
5. Coordinate with Gautam to confirm the status and readiness of the exchange rate API for the Chilean peso.
6. Discuss and finalize the design for updating the GL rate table and sending the data to BRM.
7. Prepare for future expansion to include additional LATAM currencies as needed.

Here are the key points from the discussion regarding Currency Exchange Rates:

Key Discussion Points:
- The need to incorporate Chilean peso (CLP) and other LATAM currencies into the exchange rate update process.
- The current program/API fetches exchange rates between a source and a destination currency for a given date range.
- There is a requirement to extend the program to handle multiple destination currencies (e.g., DOP, CLP, etc.) in a loop, as the API only supports one pair per call.
- The exchange rates should be stored in the GL rates table, and care should be taken not to overwrite existing data.
- The team discussed using a lookup to iterate through all required currencies and fetch rates for each.

Questions Raised:
- Can the program/API be modified to handle multiple destination currencies in a single run (via a loop)?
- What are the exact input parameters required for the API/program?
- Is there a need to build a new program, or can the existing one be modified with minor changes?
- How will the program ensure it does not overwrite existing exchange rate data?
- What is the best way to structure the lookup for all LATAM currencies?

Program Details & Requirements:
- The program should call the API for each required currency pair (USD to DOP, USD to CLP, etc.).
- The API parameters are: source currency, destination currency, start date, end date.
- The program should store the fetched rates in the GL rates table.
- The logic should be flexible to add more currencies in the future (e.g., Paraguay).
- The program should be reviewed and possibly shared for further study and modification.

Input Parameters (for the API/program):
- Source currency (e.g., USD)
- Destination currency (e.g., DOP, CLP, etc.)
- Start date
- End date
