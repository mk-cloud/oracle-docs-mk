Here are the key points from the discussion regarding Currency Exchange Rates:

Key Discussion Points:
- The need to incorporate Chilean peso (CLP) and other LATAM currencies into the exchange rate update process.
- The current program/API fetches exchange rates between a source and a destination currency for a given date range.
- There is a requirement to extend the program to handle multiple destination currencies (e.g., DOP, CLP, etc.) in a loop, as the API only supports one pair per call.
- The exchange rates should be stored in the GL rates table, and care should be taken not to overwrite existing data.
- The team discussed using a lookup to iterate through all required currencies and fetch rates for each.

Questions Raised:
- Can the program/API be modified to handle multiple destination currencies in a single run (via a loop)?
- What are the exact input parameters required for the API/program?
- Is there a need to build a new program, or can the existing one be modified with minor changes?
- How will the program ensure it does not overwrite existing exchange rate data?
- What is the best way to structure the lookup for all LATAM currencies?

Program Details & Requirements:
- The program should call the API for each required currency pair (USD to DOP, USD to CLP, etc.).
- The API parameters are: source currency, destination currency, start date, end date.
- The program should store the fetched rates in the GL rates table.
- The logic should be flexible to add more currencies in the future (e.g., Paraguay).
- The program should be reviewed and possibly shared for further study and modification.

Input Parameters (for the API/program):
- Source currency (e.g., USD)
- Destination currency (e.g., DOP, CLP, etc.)
- Start date
- End date
