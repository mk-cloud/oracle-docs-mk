Here’s a summary and a list of important key points from the meeting:

Summary:
The meeting focused on the upcoming transition to the GFS billing system, expected to go live in October. The team discussed the data flow architecture, how customer and address data will be managed in the new system, and clarified integration points between Oracle, BRM, CDH, and other modules. The group also addressed process changes, technical details, and the need for additional training sessions to ensure a smooth transition.

Key Points:
1. September will be the last billing cycle under the old system; GFS will take over billing from October, pending a go/no-go decision.
2. The data flow architecture for the new system was explained, including how customer and address data are handled.
3. New customer addresses will be integrated directly from CDH to Oracle, with specific rules for invoice and billing addresses.
4. Existing customer address changes are rare but have a separate integration path.
5. The process for invoice generation, tax calculation (using Vertex), and item creation was detailed.
6. There are some changes for specific entities (e.g., BOA Visa) regarding address handling.
7. The team discussed the handling of proforma invoices and the approval process involving customers.
8. No major changes are expected for revenue accounting, cash management, or commission processes, except for some enhancements and automation.
9. The need for additional training sessions and possible extension of meeting dates was acknowledged to ensure all topics are covered thoroughly.
10. The team agreed to pause and continue the discussion in the next session, with a focus on covering all critical points at a manageable pace.
