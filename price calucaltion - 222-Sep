Here are the key important points from the meeting held on 2025-09-23:

1. Transaction type "110" will be used for both export and intercompany invoices, with a plan to create a separate type for manual intercompany invoices.
2. Export/foreign customers are identified by taxpayer IDs starting with 555.
3. Grouping logic for invoice lines was discussed, including handling of decimalsâ€”CLP currency does not allow decimals, and validation is required.
4. Action items for Vinay:
   - Check the logic for handling null values in pricing tag, commitment flag, and discount group fields (reference Argentina code).
   - Review customer number/identifier handling and ensure the correct value is sent to EIO.
   - Complete the grouping logic based on alternate transaction description and calculation of unit price.
5. Action items for Shashi:
   - Create and populate data for pricing tag, commitment flag, and discount group fields in the staging table.
   - Make changes in the staging table to include new fields and provide data to Vinay.
   - Add validation for commercial activity description fields (33 and 34).
6. Manual creation of intercompany customers was discussed, with a follow-up call scheduled with Eduardo to clarify which customers need to be created.
7. Staging table changes and data flow between systems were reviewed, including how data is passed and validated.
8. Next steps include code migration in two stages, customer testing, and further meetings to finalize logic and data requirements.
