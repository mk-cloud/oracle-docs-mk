Error Handling
Questions to ask:

What error codes and messages should we expect?
How are validation errors structured in the response?
What's the retry policy for failed requests?
Are there specific error codes for rate limiting, auth failures, etc.?
How should timeout scenarios be handled?

Environment & Testing
Questions to ask:

What environments are available (dev, UAT, staging, prod)?
Are there different endpoints for each environment?
Is there a sandbox with test data available?
Can we get sample test data or test accounts?
Is there a Postman collection or OpenAPI/Swagger documentation?
Are there any mock services available?

Integration Specifics
Questions to ask:

Are there any webhook/callback mechanisms?
Is pagination supported, and how does it work?
How are data updates handled (real-time, batch, scheduled)?
Are there any data filtering or sorting capabilities?
What's the data retention policy?
Are there any dependencies on other services/APIs?

Monitoring & Support
Questions to ask:

How can we monitor API health and availability?
Is there a status page for the API?
What logging is available on the API side?
How should correlation IDs be used for troubleshooting?
Who is the technical contact for API issues?
What's the escalation process for production issues?
Are there any scheduled maintenance windows?

MDM-Specific Questions
Questions to ask:

What MDM data/entities are exposed through this API?
How often is the master data updated?
How are data conflicts resolved?
What's the golden record selection logic?
Are there any data governance rules we should be aware of?
How are data quality scores/confidence levels indicated?
Can we subscribe to master data change events?

Documentation & Compliance
Questions to ask:

Where can we find the complete API documentation?

Timeline & Next Steps
Questions to ask:

When will the API be ready for integration testing?

How are API updates communicated?

Additional Technical Clarifications
Questions to ask:

Do you support asynchronous operations?
Is there support for batch operations?
What date/time format should be used?
How are null vs. empty values handled?
Is there field-level encryption for sensitive data?
What character encoding is supported?
Are there any special headers we need to be aware of beyond the three mentioned?

Action Items Section:
