MD120 Technical Migration Document
REST API Code Migration in Oracle E-Business Suite (User Training Version)

1. Objective
To migrate and register the custom REST API (xxar_arg_afip_val_pkg.pls) in Oracle E-Business Suite using Integrated SOA Gateway, ensuring secure and accessible API operations. This document includes step-by-step screenshots for user training.

2. Migration Steps
2.1. Package Preparation and Compilation
- Place xxar_arg_afip_val_pkg.pls in the /tmp directory on the target server.
- Compile the PL/SQL package and generate the .ildt file:
    $IAS_ORACLE_HOME/perl/bin/perl $FND_TOP/bin/irep_parser.pl -g -v -username=sysadmin ar:patch/115/sql:xxar_arg_afip_val_pkg.pls:12.0=/tmp/xxar_arg_afip_val_pkg.pls
  [Insert Screenshot 1: Perl command execution in terminal]
- Load the .ildt file to Oracle EBS using FNDLOAD:
    $FND_TOP/bin/FNDLOAD apps/<APPS_PWD> 0 Y UPLOAD $FND_TOP/patch/115/import/wfirep.lct xxar_arg_afip_val_pkg_pls.ildt
