**Subject: URGENT: Approval Required to Open September Period in UAT - Kyriba Testing**

**To:** [Finance Manager/System Administrator]  
**Cc:** Adrian Mendizábal, Ipshita Gupta, Katherine Camacho, [Project Manager]

Dear [Manager Name],

I am writing to request urgent approval to **reopen the September 2025 period in the UAT environment** for critical Kyriba Journal Entries Export testing.

**Background:**
- Our UAT environment was recently cloned and the code has been remigrated
- Adrian had previously sent test files with September dates, but we were initially requested to use October dates as the September period was closed in UAT
- However, we've now discovered that our test environment refresh schedule only contains September data

**Critical Issue:**
As confirmed by Adrian Mendizábal, the test refresh that occurred on **9/24** has resulted in our test environment containing data only from **9/21**. This means we cannot proceed with October period testing as originally planned.

**Business Impact:**
- Testing for the Kyriba Payment File Outbound integration is currently blocked
- The Chile-Citi Bank payment integration testing cannot proceed without this
- This delay impacts our go-live timeline for the payment automation project

**Specific Request:**
We need to reopen the September period in UAT to process test files for the following dates:
- 09/10/2025 (15 transactions)
- 09/11/2025 (16 transactions)
- 09/12/2025 (15 transactions)
- 09/13/2025 (32 transactions)

**Justification:**
Opening the September period is the most efficient solution as:
1. All test data is already available for September
2. Re-running the test environment refresh for October would cause significant delays
3. The test files are already prepared with September dates

Please see the attached email thread for complete context and discussion among the team.

We kindly request your approval by **[specific time]** today to avoid further testing delays.

Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Title]
