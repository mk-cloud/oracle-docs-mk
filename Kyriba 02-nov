Regarding acknowledgement, it was discussed that "acknowledgement files" are the files received as confirmation of payment status and file status. 
At this stage, no new information on acknowledgement was available from the AP team, 
and it was recommended that this be checked with Ipshita for an update. It was also suggested to track this topic in Gory's updates so everyone can monitor its progress.


Here are the key important points from the meeting:

- Ongoing issues and escalations with ticket logging and visibility, especially for Wells Fargo and Kariba.
- Payment processing changes are impacting the Brazil team, with recent adjustments by Chris, and the need to review how those changes affect approvals.
- Statements and payments are being tested post-migration to UAT; issues with receiving and processing statements were noted, and team changes (Chinmaya and Power replacing Shankar and Subrancha) were announced.
- Outstanding questions about acknowledgement files (confirmation of payment/file status) remain, and further information will be checked with Ipshita and tracked in team updates.
- There is an impending significant change in API certification coming in May 2026, requiring coordination with internal IT and considerations for client impact.
- Implementing and supporting bank APIs is universally challenging, with the group agreeing on a cautious and flexible approach due to uncertain timelines and requirements.
- Specific action items include: reaching out to Chris about Brazil payments impact, escalating tickets with Yash, and planning for API certification transition.
