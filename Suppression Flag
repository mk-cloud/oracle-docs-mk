Here's the detailed breakdown of Proforma and Suppression:

Proforma Invoice Scenario:
- Invoices are created and sent out at a specific time (e.g., 5 PM)
- Customer might approve the invoice shortly after
- Later, the operations team might realize the invoice needs to be suppressed

Suppression Process:
1. If an invoice is mistakenly approved but needs to be suppressed:
- The operations team will need to update the staging table
- They must add a suppression flag in both their system and the current system
- The goal is to prevent the suppressed invoice from being sent to SI (System Integrator)

Key Requirements:
- Check two conditions before sending an invoice:
  1. Approval flag is 'Yes'
  2. Suppression flag is 'No'
- If either condition is not met, the invoice should not be sent
- The system needs to handle near real-time suppression, potentially checking every half-hour

The team is working on designing a robust process to handle these edge cases in invoice management.
