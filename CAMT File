Based on the conversation, here are the key points about profiles:

Profile Details:
- Profiles are country-specific (e.g., USD for USA, CAD for Canada, IRA for Ireland)
- When running the program, you must check the profile to determine the country
- Different profiles have different bank number ranges (e.g., USD profile bank numbers start with 5411634)
- The program should combine the profile and bank number for searching and processing files

Profile Access Restrictions:
- The City bank statement program can be accessed by:
  - USD (United States)
  - CAD (Canada)
  - Currently excluding other countries
- Wells Fargo program will have a different access configuration
