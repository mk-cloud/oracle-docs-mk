Based on the email regarding the Kyriba New Outbound Program Development, here's the information you'll need:

**Required Information:**

- UID (User ID) for inbound acknowledgement file placement
- Designated inbound folder location/path
- File format for acknowledgement files
- File naming convention
- File transfer protocol (SFTP/FTP details)
- SFTP/FTP server credentials (host, port, username)
- Source folder path where Kyriba places acknowledgement files
- Destination folder path for AP Team Distribution List
- Email distribution list for AP Team
- File processing frequency/schedule
- Success/failure notification email recipients
- Error handling procedure requirements
- File archive location/retention policy
- Business owner contact information
- Technical contact information for Kyriba team
- Expected file size/volume
- Encryption requirements (GPG/PGP keys if applicable)
- File delimiter/separator specifications
- Character encoding (UTF-8, ASCII, etc.)
- Business process triggering rules


Here are the key points from your meeting:

**Important Points:**
- You need to process inbound XML files using a shell script or similar program.
- Reuse or modify an existing program or shell script found in the DBA source/APO directory—especially those already handling logging and file processing.
- Files should be archived after processing; use existing archive folders, no need to create new ones.
- The archive (sometimes called "process" folder) is standard for all such programs.
- Use a UID and, if needed, an encryption key (check if encryption is required for your files).
- For sending acknowledgment files by email, avoid hardcoding addresses; use a lookup or distribution list.
- Scheduling and authentication requirements need confirmation—check with Katherine.
- Start development with any sample XML file, adjust code as details become available.

**Whom to Contact for Existing Program Information:**
- The Support Team (for examples/support)
- Tarun
- Katherine (for testing email address, scheduling, and possibly DL email ID)
- Chinma (may not remember details offhand, but could be helpful)
- Other colleagues familiar with emailing from the server

**Description:**
The goal is to create or modify a shell script/program that:
- Monitors for inbound XML files in a specific directory.
- Processes these files (possibly converting into an LOB).
- Logs activity and archives the files after processing.
- Optionally encrypts/decrypts files as required.
- Sends processed files by email, using a lookup for dynamic email addresses.
- Scheduling, authentication, and final naming conventions should be finalized in consultation with Katherine or Support.
