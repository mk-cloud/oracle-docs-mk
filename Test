Option 1: Event-Level Rounding
How it works: Round each transaction individually to the nearest whole number, then add them up.
Example:
Each transaction: 47.38 → rounded to 47.
Total: 47 + 47 + 47 + 47 = 188.

Key point: The total might not match the actual sum of the original amounts (which is 189.52) because rounding happens before adding. This can cause a mismatch between your accounts receivable (AR) and general ledger (GL).

Option 2: Header-Level Rounding
How it works: Add all transactions first without rounding, then round the header total to the nearest whole number.
Example:
Sum of transactions: 47.38 + 47.38 + 47.38 + 47.38 = 189.52.
Then round 189.52 → 190.
Key point: The invoice total  Amount is rounded only once, 
but the individual transactions keep their original values. 

This may also cause a gap between AR and GL because the details don't match the rounded total.
Simple Analogy:

Think of Option 1 as rounding each item's price at the checkout before summing, while Option 2 is summing all items first and then rounding the total bill. The final amount can differ slightly between the two methods.

For CLP (Chilean Pesos): Rounds to whole numbers (0 decimal places)

For USD (US Dollars): Rounds to 2 decimal places (cents)
