Here are the key points from this discussion:

1. Logic Implementation:
   - Implement logic for non-commitment/non-progressive, commitment, and progressive invoice lines.
   - For commitment lines, group and sum values, and for progressive lines, order from lowest to highest amount.
   - Zero-rated (amount = 0) usage lines should be suppressed.

2. Prioritization:
   - Commitment logic takes precedence over alternate description grouping if both apply.
   - Grouping by alternate invoice description is only used if commitment logic does not apply.

3. Progressive Tier Handling:
   - For progressive pricing type, do not apply grouping logic; send lines as-is, ordered by amount (lowest to highest).
   - If more than 21 tiers are present, further clarification is needed.

4. Data Fields and Grouping:
   - Use fields like group ID, commitment flag, pricing type, and service period for grouping and logic.
   - For commitment, group by invoice number and DSL group, with quantity set to one and amount as the sum.

5. Handling Special Cases:
   - Remove zero-value lines before applying any logic.
   - For credit notes, negative amounts should be handled as per requirements.

6. Open Questions:
   - Some points, such as the handling of more than 21 progressive tiers and the use of certain flags, require further clarification.

7. Next Steps:
   - Vinay to review the code and logic, write out the steps, and discuss any discrepancies or questions in the next meeting.

Hereâ€™s an example based on the discussion:

Suppose you have the following invoice lines from BRM:

| Line | Commitment Flag | Pricing Type  | Amount | Description         |
|------|----------------|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| 1    | 1              | Non-progressive | 1000   | Product A           |
| 2    | 2              | Non-progressive | 2000   | Product A           |
| 3    | 0              | Progressive     | 500    | Product B           |
| 4    | 0              | Progressive     | 700    | Product B           |
| 5    | 0              | Non-progressive | 0      | Product C (zero)    |

Applying the discussed logic:
- First, remove zero-value lines (Line 5 is suppressed).
- For commitment lines (Lines 1 & 2, flag 1 or 2, non-progressive):
  - Group by invoice number and group ID (if applicable).
  - Quantity is set to 1.
  - Amount is the sum: 1000 + 2000 = 3000.
  - Output: 1 line for Product A, Quantity: 1, Amount: 3000.
- For progressive lines (Lines 3 & 4, pricing type progressive):
  - No grouping, just order by amount (lowest to highest).
  - Output: Line 3 (500), then Line 4 (700).

Final output to EIO:
1. Product A (Commitment): Quantity 1, Amount 3000
2. Product B (Progressive): Quantity as per original, Amount 500
3. Product B (Progressive): Quantity as per original, Amount 700

--- Action items

Action Items
[ ] @Vinay Kaveti - Implement the commitment line logic to summarize the lines and send a single line to the EIO.
[ ] @Vinay Kaveti - Implement the progressive line logic to send the lines as-is, ordered from lowest to highest line amount.
[ ] @Vinay Kaveti - Implement the logic to eliminate zero-value lines before applying any other logic.
[ ] Follow up with the team to understand the scenario with more than 21 tiers.

Pricing and grouping for tires. 26:41

Unknown Speaker: Progressive lines should be sent as is, without grouping.

Sujit: Quantity one is not accepted by AD, so unit price should be populated.

Vinay: Huge loss is applied for 3.2, but grouping logic is not required.

Invoice PDFs, commitment amounts, and group ID. 36:42

The problem statement is that the invoice PDFs for commitment products display a single line with the total commitment amount, but the alternate description is not groupable.

The solution is to remove the service period and do the remaining fields, but the group ID is not used for us.
